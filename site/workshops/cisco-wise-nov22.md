In this session, David will review many categories of services within Amazon Web Services including compute, storage, and databases.  At each step, David will provide a workshop-style lab that will enable you to get hands-on with one of the services. If you are new to AWS, David will provide an introductory lab that will guide you through basic actions using a core service.  If you already experiences with the platform, David will have advanced options for the labs that will help you take your skills to the next level.
