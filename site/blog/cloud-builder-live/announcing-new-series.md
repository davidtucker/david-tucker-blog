I really excited to bring a new series to all of you that is focused on building solutions in the cloud! I've partnered with both [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com) and [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com/) to make this a reality.

This series will focus on using multiple cloud services together to create cloud-based solutions.  I'll be covering AWS, Azure, and GCP with a new focus each month.  The [first episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDnSTs2J6fk&list=PLIopdAXlIWi3KPAxVqAg9RWq7tQ0r70mO) is launching on February 10th, so make sure to join me live on both YouTube and Twitch.  If you can't make it live, no worries.  You can come back and watch the entire episode on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIopdAXlIWi3KPAxVqAg9RWq7tQ0r70mO).  

I'll be launching a new episode each month, so stay tuned for episode announcements.
