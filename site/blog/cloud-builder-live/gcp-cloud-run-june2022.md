I had a blast diving into GCP with the viewers on this episode! Since I know that there are many developers who haven't touched the Google Cloud Platform, I wanted to truly start from the beginning.  I spend some time at the beginning walking through how to get started with a GCP account if you haven't created one yet.  After this, I give you an understanding of the different compute services for GCP and explain why we will be using [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run).

Once we dive into GCP, I covered deploying a REST API (included in the GitHub repository) using Cloud Run.  We even setup continuous delivery and deployment using the built-in support with Cloud Run.  I even examined some advanced use cases using traffic management for different revisions within our application.
