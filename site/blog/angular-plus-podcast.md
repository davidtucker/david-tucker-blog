I had a great time chatting with the crew on the [Angular Plus Podcast](https://spoti.fi/3QYLSFS) about up-leveling your cloud skills.

## Pluralsight Links

I referred to several Pluralsight courses on the podcast.  You can find links to those below:

- [All My Pluralsight Courses](http://pluralsight.davidtucker.net)
- [AWS Cloud Practitioner Learning Path](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/k7j0N)
- [AWS Serverless Learning Path](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/OReqan)

## The Coffee Table

In addition to discussing cloud concepts, I also somehow ended up on the topic of woodworking.  I referred to the coffee table I built here for my home.  You can checkout the pictures below to see the process of going from unfinished to finished.  As mentioned, I am no woodworking expert, but that is part of the reason I do it.

I ended up paiting the lower part and the drawers white.  I used a [General Finishes gel stain](https://generalfinishes.com/wood-finishes-retail/oil-based-wood-stains-sealers/gel-stains) on the top of the table.
