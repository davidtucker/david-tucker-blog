I regularly use my video studio for Pluralsight courses, recurring video episodes for shows I contribute to, and for video presentations I record for my clients. Let me show you what I use.<!--more-->

## Single-Person Shoots

One of the things that is unique about my setup is that I try to make everything self-service. It is my goal to record whatever I need without having to bring anyone else in to assist.  This has driven the equipment that I have chosen. 

## Camera

I recently switched to the [Sony A1](https://amzn.to/3LftwOC) as my primary camera. I utilize [24-70mm G Master](https://amzn.to/3BIdtp7) lens. In addition, I use a [Tiffin Pro Mist filter](https://amzn.to/3dfvMZt) on the lens to soften the overall image. 

## Lighting

I utilize two primary lights. I actuall have a dual key light setup to combat the shadows that come from my glasses. Each of these are [Amaran 100D's](https://amzn.to/3LwGbwR) with the [Mini Light Dome II](https://amzn.to/3RU2TkU). In addition, I have a handful of accent light, primarily the [Aputure MC4](https://amzn.to/3eTBwIK), which provides four portable lights along with a handy charging case.

Since all of these lights use [Sidus Link](https://www.sidus.link/), I can use a single app to adjust all lighting. This allows me to adjust lighting while watching the monitor I have attached to the camera.

## Monitor & Teleprompter

I utilize the [Atomos Ninja Flame](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1329150-REG/atomos_atomnjafl2_ninja_flame_unit_soft.html) monitor to provide me a view into the camera output.  I have used this as a recorder, but I don't generally use it for this at the moment. I don't believe that this particular model is still available, but you can find similar ones from Atomos.

I also utilize an iPad-based teleprompter. The company that made my teleprompter is no longer around, but there are some [good options](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1610382-REG/glide_gear_tmp_100_ipad_smartphone_teleprompter.html) that you can review.

## Conclusion

I'll provide a full video overview of this studio in the near future.  I want to give you a behind the scenes look at what it looks like to record one of the series that I contribute to.
